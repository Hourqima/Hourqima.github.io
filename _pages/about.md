Hello! My name is Qixiao Yuan, but I prefer to use Hourqima as a nickname, as my original name is a little difficult to remember. I am now an undergraduate student at the school of the gifted youngs(SCGY) in the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC).

I entered USTC in 2023 and I joined the Jici Yan talent program in 2024. Now I am majoring in Physics, specifically in Condensed matter physics. I also have a great interest on Theoretical physics and Mathematics. 

I am also a great lover of music. I was a lover of progressive rock music before, and I started to try different genres of music after entering USTC. My favourite artist is Frank Zappa. Now I enjoy discovering underground folk music and psychedelic rock from Japan. I love literature and poems as well, such as “À la recherche du temps perdu” and the poems of Eliot and Lorca.

I have certificates of painting and chinese flute, but I haven't practiced them for a long time. I can play badminton and table tennis as well, but only as an amaetur.
